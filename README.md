Backend server for the Visiting Card project

The function of this server is to store the data of the visiting-card-android app. The tech stack chosen for the server is Django, and the main objective of is to create a RESTful Web Service (REST API) in Django which should be able to perform operation like so:

* GET operation -To Retrieve data/Information and will return a list of visiting cards
* PUT operation - To modify an already stored Visiting Card
* POST operation - To store a new Visiting Card
* DELETE operation - To Delete a Visiting Card

This RESTful web service (REST API) will be later on integrated with the visiting-card-android app and will handle its complete backend.
